            <h4><u>Let's Learn about Cricket!</u></h4>
            <br>
            <p>Cricket is an 11-person team sport eloquently labelled as "The Gentleman's Game".
            <br>It involves a bowler bowling a leather cricket ball to an opposing team batsman who, in turn, attempts to hit the ball 
            to score a "run" while the rest of the bowler's team tries to prevent this. The bowler bowls 6 legitimate balls in a row before the next bowler gets a chance
            and it is called an "over". Matches are then seperated into either 20 overs per team, 50 overs per team or even a 5 day test matches with up to 90 overs per day!

            <h5><u>Understanding the Ins and Outs</u></h5>
            <p>Cricket is admittedly a sport with many rules, as the block of writing before the image above may have indicated.
                However, once broken down and understood, these rules contribute to an enthralling and fascinating sport! 
            <br><br> The best place to start when trying to understand cricket is by learning the way a batsman can get out. 
            These ways of getting out, or "modes of dismissal", are all indicated below. Numbers 1 - 5 are the most common ways a wicket is taken (batsman gets out)
            The rest of the dismissal types are rare, but they are legitimate ways of getting out and have do occur if the batsman in rare instances</p>

                Now we understand that this may be a little confusing! But this can be further explained by splitting up the two different facets of the game, namely Batting and Bowling. 
                As mentioned, each team will take turns batting and bowling, with the order of which being chosen by a coin toss at the beginning of the match. 
                <br><br>
                Then, for example if team A wins the toss and elects to Bat, 2 batsman will go to bat and the Bowling team will attempt to get each batsman out. The batting team will then bat
                until either 10 wickets are taken (i.e. only one batsman left) or the total amount of overs are up.
                <br><br>
                Finally, once these both teams have batted and bowled, the team that has scored the most runs wins! Now, if you are still confused, we have seperated sections of <a href="Batting.html">Batting</a>and <a href="Bowling.html">Bowling</a>
                into seperate pages for further explanation. Please feel free to visit these pages if you wish to learn mor about this beautiful game!
