            <h4><u>Let's learn about BATTING!</u></h4>
            <br>
            <p>Batting is essentially the <b>point</b> of cricket! </p>
            <p>Let me explain... The manner in which a cricket game is won is by scoring the most runs.
                And how are runs scored? By BATTING!
                Now, as you can see in the image below, runs are scored when a batsman hits the ball 
                after the bowler bowls it to him in an attempt to get him out.
            </p>
            <p>As the image also shows, the batsman also wears a variety of protective equipment, 
                including the following:</p>
            <div class="container">
                <ul>
                    <li>Gloves</li>
                    <li>Pads (legs)</li>
                    <li>Helmet</li>
                    <li>Thigh-pads (Inside the long white pants)</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            
        </div>

            <h5><u>Calling the Shots</u></h5>
            
                <p for="Info" id="Batting">Another small detail regarding batting is included in the caption of the image above. The batsman in the image is playing a "cover drive". 
                This is one of the many different types of shots that can be played by the batsman. 
                <br><br>These shots are usually dictated by the placement of the fielders
                (i.e. the rest of the players on the bowler's team) as the batsman wants to avoid hitting the ball to them.
                The placement of the fielders also has individual names for each placement, as these positions have become standardised over the years.
                These fielding positions are detailed further in the <a class="text-white" href="Bowling.html">Bowling</a> section of this website.</p>

            <p>The image below is a depiction of a traditional cricket pitch. The umpires, who govern the game from either end of the pitch, stand behind the stumps.
                The stumps are the 3 wickets that stand at the end of the pitch with bails on top. It is a 22 yard strip of specially prepared ground.
                The horizontal lines on either end of the pitch are called the "creases". These creases are used to monitor many of the rules 
                of cricket. Some of these rules include:
