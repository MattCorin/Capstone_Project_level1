Once these files are downloaded, they must then be extracted to a folder of your choice on your computer by right-clicking on the downloaded zip folder and clicking "Extract All...". 
<br><br>
Once extracted, the website can be used on your local machine! Simply navigate inside the "Criceket_website" folder, and within the "HTML_pages" folder, double-click on the "index.html" file to open the home page.
